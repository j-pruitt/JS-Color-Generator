# JS-Color-Generator

JS-Color-Generator is a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to generate color codes. By pressing respective buttons, users can cycle through the formula for hex codes or linear gradients, all powered by JavaScript arrays and functions.

## Features

- HEX Code Generation: The app uses a JavaScript array to generate random HEX color codes, providing an exciting visual experience.
- Linear Gradient Code: JS-Color-Generator enables users to create captivating linear gradient codes with the click of a button.

## To-Do List

- Improve Design: The current design is rudimentary, and there is room for enhancements to achieve a more polished display. (Work in progress, no rush)

## Preview

To see the JS-Color-Generator in action, you can check it out on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/j-pruitt/pen/gOdoNxq).

## Usage

1. HEX Code Generation:
   - Click on the "HEX CODE" button to generate a random HEX color code.
   - Observe the changes in the background color of "Container 1" and the displayed HEX code.

2. Linear Gradient Code:
   - Click on the "LINEAR GRADIENT CODE" button to generate a random linear gradient.
   - Observe the changes in the background of "Container 2" and the displayed gradient code.

## How It Works

The app uses JavaScript arrays and functions to generate random colors and linear gradient codes. The logic is divided into two containers: "Container 1" for HEX codes and "Container 2" for linear gradients.
