# JS-Color-Generator
 
HTML/CSS/JS Web Based App to generate color codes. Pressing respective buttons cycles through the formula for hex codes or linear gradients using JS Arrays and Functions.

TO DO:
 Clean Up the design theories that are there and shoot for a less ruimentary display.
  (This is no rush)
